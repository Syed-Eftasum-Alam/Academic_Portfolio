This online art gallery provides a space where artists can upload and showcase their creations, allowing them to reach a wider audience and sell their artworks directly. At the same time, customers can easily browse, select, and purchase pieces of art through the platform. Additionally, gallery owners can use Art_patio to promote and announce upcoming exhibitions or events, making it a comprehensive hub for the art community. The project reflects a strong vision of supporting artistic expression in the digital age while leveraging technology to connect creative individuals.",

      description: "Pawsitive is a JavaFX-based desktop applications to facilitate pet adoption. The platform allows users to sign up, log in, search for pets, submit adoption requests, and manage a list of favorite animals. It also enables users to add new pets for adoption and automatically sends email notifications upon adoption requests. The user interface is built with JavaFX and SceneBuilder, and the application requires a separate pet server (also available in the developerâ€™s GitHub profile) to function. While the app includes core features like pet listings and email notifications, it currently lacks a built-in chat system for real-time communication between adopters and pet owners",

      title: "Currency-Converter",
      description: "Currency Converter is a lightweight command-line application developed in pure C . Designed for Windows systems, it offers real-time currency conversion using free APIs, enabling users to convert between various currencies, view historical exchange rates, and receive notifications on rate changes. The application supports features like viewing the highest rates from history and accessing full exchange rate histories. However, due to limitations of the free API used, historical data is restricted to the past year, and rates for volatile currencies like Bitcoin may not always be up-to-date. The project includes a MainMenu.c file for compilation, and utilizes external libraries such as rlutil and cJSON for enhanced functionality. It's a practical tool for users seeking a straightforward currency conversion utility without the need for a graphical interface",
